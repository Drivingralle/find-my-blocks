# Box

`Box` is an empty element a tag and any amount of props you would like to pass
it. All props passed into a `Box` will be applied to the tag that is used.

It is best practice to only use a `Box` element for layouts. **Do not** use it
for things like links and paragraphs.

## Usage

```ts
import { Box } from '../components/Box';
```

<Playground>
    <Box>Just a div</Box>
    <Box tag="span" className="aClass">Span with a class</Box>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={ Box } />
