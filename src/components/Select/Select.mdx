# Select

Select is a component that **you** just made! It's lovely...

## Usage

```

<Playground>
    <Select onChange={(val) => alert(val)} defaultValue="sims">
        <Option value='eddy'>Eddy</Option>
        <Option value="sims">Sims</Option>
        <Option value="har">A really long option that could be blocked by the arrow in the background... but maybe not as well...</Option>
    </Select>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={ Select } />

## Options

<Props of={ Option } />

## Size

Select can be displayed at 3 different sizes. How incredible is that?
