# Layout

Layout is a **very** opinionated component that takes slots of React nodes as
layout elements. It is a dumb, display only component that will layout the
specific areas of the plugin.

Layout is not made responsive at this moment as I don't think that there are
many people editing from their mobile devices.

## Usage

```ts
import { Layout } from "../components/Layout";
```

<Playground>
  <Layout
    title="Find My Blocks"
    sidebar={<div>SIDEBAR</div>}
    settings={
      <Card title="Settings" toggle={true} initialOpen={false}>
        Some Settings
      </Card>
    }
    cards={<div>CARDS</div>}
  />
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Layout} />
