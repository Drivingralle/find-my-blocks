# Card

```js
import { Card } from './Card';
```

## Basic usage

The card is used to display post information. It is also a dumb component, that only accepts children.

<Playground>
  <Card>
    <Content>
      Cards have some content.
    </Content>
    <Alert type="success">This card is safe, I promise</Alert>
  </Card>
</Playground>
