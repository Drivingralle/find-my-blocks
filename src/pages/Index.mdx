# Find My Blocks

Find My Blocks is a WordPress plugin to help (as it says in the name) to find where you have used your Gutenberg blocks on your WordPress website.

Gutenberg can be a great tool to make managing content on your WordPress website easier. However after a while, updating blocks can become a hassle for developers. It is hard to keep track of what posts/pages blocks are used on, or how many times they are used. This makes maintaining Gutenberg websites quite difficult.

Find my blocks is a tool that is here to help. With Find My Blocks you can see:

- A list of all the blocks types that are in use on your WordPress site.
- The amount of times a specific block type has been used on your WordPress site.
- The posts/pages that a block has been used on.
- The amount of times a block has been used on a specific post/page.
- If the block is a “Reusable Block”
- A filtered list of block names to help you find the block that you are looking for.
