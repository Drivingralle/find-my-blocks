## Submitting an Issue

Although I try very, very hard to keep this plugin bug-free. Sometimes thingss
out of our control happen. There are 2 main ways that you can submit bugs to 
Find My Blocks.

### [Github](https://github.com/eddysims/find-my-blocks/issues): 

Find My Blocks is an open source project, which means that anyone can readily
see the code that powers the plugin. This code is hosted on a site called 
Github.

To submit an issue, click 
[here](https://github.com/eddysims/find-my-blocks/issues) and then the button
labeled `New Issue`. Fill out the information asked for. 

On the right hand side you will see an option to add a label. Use the label
`bug` to report a bug or issue with the plugin, or use the label
`feature request` to request some new functionality.

### [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/find-my-blocks/):

You can also report a bug or feature request through
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/find-my-blocks/) support
topics. 

To report a bug on WordPress please prefix your topic with `BUG:` and for a new
feature or functionality, please prefix your topic with `REQUEST:`. This will
help to prioritize what to work on next.

bit of PHP used to handle the WordPress features.
