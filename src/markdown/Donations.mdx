# Donations

## Thank you

`Find My Blocks` was created and is maintained to make developers life easier.
It is maintained solely by myself, [Eddy Sims](https://eddysims.com/) as a side
project that I work on in my spare time.

Thank you for visiting this page, and (hopefully) using my plugin. I hope that
it can continue to help people in the same way that it helped me when I first
created it.

If you feel that `Find My Blocks` has been helping your workflow, and allowing
you to be more productive, please consider
[donating](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme2/eddysims) to show your
appriciation.
